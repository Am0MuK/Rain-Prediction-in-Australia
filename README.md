# Rain-Prediction-in-Australia
The "Rain-Prediction-in-Australia" contains a data science project focusing on predicting rain in Australia using machine learning.

The repository includes a Jupyter notebook that guides the user through the data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, model selection, and evaluation. The notebook is well-documented and includes explanations of the data and methods used, as well as code snippets and visualizations to help the user understand the process.

The dataset used in the project contains historical weather data from various locations across Australia. The goal is to predict whether or not it will rain tomorrow in a particular location based on the weather conditions and other factors from the previous day.

The notebook includes a thorough analysis of the dataset, including visualizations and statistical summaries. The user is then guided through the process of selecting and training various machine learning models, including Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and XGBoost. The models are evaluated using various metrics, and the best performing model is selected for use in predicting rain in Australia.

Overall, the "Rain-Prediction-in-Australia" repository is a well-documented and comprehensive example of a machine learning project, providing a great resource for anyone looking to learn more about data science and machine learning.
